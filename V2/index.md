# Tutorial: deep-research

**Deep Research** is an AI-powered research assistant that **automates comprehensive web research**. It takes a user's question, *searches the web* for relevant information, learns from the results, and generates *follow-up questions* to dig deeper. This creates a **research feedback loop** that progressively refines the investigation. Finally, it compiles all findings into either a detailed report or a specific answer, depending on the user's needs.
