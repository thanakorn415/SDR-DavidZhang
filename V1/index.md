# Tutorial: deep-research

**Deep Research** is an AI-powered research assistant that performs *comprehensive investigation* on user queries. It works by generating **search engine queries**, retrieving and processing web content, and **synthesizing** findings into coherent reports or specific answers. The system uses a *recursive approach* to explore topics in depth, branching into related questions and following leads until reaching the specified depth. It provides both **web API** and **command-line interfaces** for users to interact with the system, making advanced research capabilities accessible to anyone.
