# Tutorial: deep-research

**Deep Research** is an AI-powered research assistant that helps users conduct comprehensive research on any topic. It integrates with *multiple AI models* (like OpenAI, Google, Anthropic) and *search engines* to gather information, analyze documents, and generate detailed reports. The application extracts text from various file formats, searches the web for relevant information, and synthesizes findings into well-structured research documents - all while maintaining security through API middleware and organizing data with state management.
