# Tutorial: open_deep_research

**Open Deep Research** is an automated research assistant that creates comprehensive reports on any topic. The system uses a **structured workflow** (either graph-based or multi-agent) to plan reports, conduct web searches, synthesize information, and generate well-organized content. It leverages *language models* for reasoning and writing while incorporating *human feedback* at critical planning stages. Think of it as an AI research team that breaks complex topics into manageable sections, researches each independently, and compiles findings into a cohesive final report with proper citations.
